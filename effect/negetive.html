    <center><h1>Negative</h1></center>
    <center><p id= parag>The school faces several issues daily that negatively impact student learning.
One of the most important things that cause the student to do bad is racism. Racial bias in school leaders and teacher affect how they interact with the student. 
This will affect the student in many ways. For example “According to the US Government Accountability Office Report on Discipline Disparities, black students are disproportionately suspended in school across the country”. 
This shows that it is unfair to the black student because if a teacher believes the negative stereotype about a student, then they will punish them for causing a very little problem. Another example is that when white students did something bad on the news they won’t make the student look that negative. 
But then when a group of black students protesting at the campus policies with signs and they were described as a riot when they did nothing. This clearly shows that is a bad sign because we cant look at them as their race. Not everyone is going to be like that. If we continue to do this we are going to corrupt our society and also it a bad model for the younger generation. Still in the south of America, there is greater racism than the north. According to a 2016 report form, the University of Pennsylvania found that 13 Southern states were responsible for 55percent of the suspension involving black students. This shows us that we need to dig the problem out first then we can stop it slowly. We need to change how does the southern thinks about black students. The student in preschool also finds that they had a higher suspension rate of black students. The races people also think that minority children are less likely to be identified as gifted. In this case, we need to stop the racism in school so the kid will have a better chance to showcase their talents.
