    <center><h1>Negative</h1></center>
    <center><p>The school faces several issues daily that negatively impact student learning.
One of the most important things that cause the student to do bad is racism. Racial bias in school leaders and teacher affect how they interact with the student. 
This will affect the student in many ways. For example “According to the US Government Accountability Office Report on Discipline Disparities, black students are disproportionately suspended in school across the country”. This shows that it is unfair to the black student because if a teacher believes the negative stereotype about a student, then they will punish them for causing a very little problem.
 Another example is that when white students did something bad on the news they won’t make the student look that negative. 
But then when a group of black students protesting at the campus policies with signs and they were described as a riot when they did nothing.
