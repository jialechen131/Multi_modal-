Now, the kids donâ€™t have that many choices because the kid will follow that their parent does. If you did something like racism the kid will copy what you will do. In other words, you need to self-awareness of your self not to show kids the negative thing because kids will learn very quickly what you did. 
Also, we must understand how our identification within a particular group gives us privilege in certain spaces and we must be open to actively listen to marginalized groups who experience life differently because of their race or social groups. We must acknowledge our personal biases first so we can know the understanding of other people with a different experience. Also in school teachers can create lessons that will teach the students about race and ethnicity and prioritize preventing racism through social justices with culturally relevant teaching.
